The circuit on EVAL-CN0349-PMDZ provides a complete, robust data acquisition solution for processing conductivity cell outputs, including temperature correction. 
This circuit is ideal for measuring the ionic content of liquids, water quality analysis, and chemical analysis.

This design solution is optimized for high precision and low cost, and it uses only five active devices. 
The circuit has a total error of less than 1% FSR after calibration. 
The small footprints of all the components make the circuit ideal for applications where printed circuit board (PCB) real estate is a premium. 
The digital output of the circuit is fully isolated; therefore, the ground loop interference is eliminated, making it ideal for harsh industrial environments.
